# 7-Habits
Habit Tracker helps you create and maintain good habits, allowing you to achieve your long-term goals. Detailed graphs and statistics show you how your habits improved over time. The app is completely ad-free and open source.

Simple, beautiful and modern interface
Habit Tracker has a minimalistic interface that is easy to use and follows the material design guidelines.

Habit score
In addition to showing your current streak, Habit Tracker has an advanced formula for calculating the strength of your habits. Every repetition makes your habit stronger, and every missed day makes it weaker. A few missed days after a long streak, however, will not completely destroy your entire progress.

Detailed graphs and statistics
Clearly see how your habits improved over time with beautiful and detailed graphs. Scroll back to see the complete history of your habits.

Flexible schedules
Supports both daily habits and habits with more complex schedules, such as 3 times every week; one time every other week; or every other day.

Reminders
Create an individual reminder for each habit, at a chosen hour of the day. Easily check, dismiss or snooze your habit directly from the notification, without opening the app.

Optimized for smartwatches
Reminders can be checked, snoozed or dismissed directly from your Android Wear watch.

Completely ad-free and open source
